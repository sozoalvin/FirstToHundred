# First To Hundred

The first to hundred game is a simple program wrriten in javascript, with the help of html and css to allow two users race each other; first person to get to 100 points wins! 

Everytime the program is run, each player gets to decide on the number of dice they want to throw and the dice scores are actually accumulated. While that sounds like an easy game, the catch is that the user would actually lose their turn if they roll a 1. 

Players have to battle their wits out on when they should hold their scores. Holding their scores would add up their tallies but that also means they will lose their turns. 

Both players have to carefully craft their bullish or bearish game strategy and may the best player win! 

As soon as the game has detected a winner, the player's profile lits up and the ```NEW GAME``` button would reset the game automatically.
